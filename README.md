# Decide - Launch Interceptor Program

## Overview
This project implements a program that decides whether an interceptor should be launched for a hypothetical anti-ballistic missile system based on 2-dimensional radar tracking information. 

The decision is made by calculating whether the relevant Launch Interceptor Conditions (LICs) for the particular launch determination are satisified, if they are the interceptor is launched. The program is implemented according to the "Launch Interceptor Program: Requirements Specification" by authors J. C. Knight and N. G. Leveson
(adapted by John Regehr and Martin Monperrus), June 16, 2016, version 5.

The repository includes:
- Implementation of all LICs and final decision function
- Unit tests for each LIC contract and final decision function
- Gradle build configuration and wrapper
- Documentation (README and decided practices)
