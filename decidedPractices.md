# Decided practice conventions in the group

- All commits are linked to an issue describing the feature / commit
- Every commit is an atomic bug fix or feature, with a clear commit message. We use the prefix convention where the commit messages starts with for example "feat", "fix", "doc", "refactor"). A link describing the used prefix convention is given by: https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13
- The commit contents reflect the commit message, every bug fix or feature commit contains a test (i.e., adds at least one test or modifies at least one existing test).
- The commits are well balanced among group members
- We use JUnit for testing
