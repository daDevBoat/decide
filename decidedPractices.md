# Decided commit conventions in the group

- All commits are linked to an issue describing the feature / commit
- Every commit is an atomic bug fix or feature, with a clear commit message. A prefix convention is appropriate, e.g., commit messages starting with "feat", "fix", "doc", "refactor").
- The commit contents reflect the commit message, every bug fix or feature commit contains a test (i.e., adds at least one test or modifies at least one existing test).
- The commits are well balanced among group members
